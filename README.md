# Poker_project
Poker project randomly select five set of cards of give and show them in the python console. The code automatically judge which set wins based on poker rules(ex. Royal Flush > Full House). The project is written in Python in my Data Structure class.

## To import the project into your computer:
1. Download all the .py file and open them in a python IDE of your choice, make sure you set up proper environment!
2. Download and unzip the .zip file that includes the .png format pictures of all pokers.
3. Move the folder that contains all the .png pictures of pokers into the same directory/folder as the .py code.
4. Line 57 in main.py retrieves images in a folder; I named it "Poker Images", just change "Poker Images" to your folder name of all .png pictures if you have a different folder name.
